            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>
                Cup of Joy started as a small dream to bring high-quality, ethically sourced coffee to our community. 
                Founded in 2015, our journey began with a simple goal: to create a warm, welcoming space for coffee lovers.

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                We believe in coffee as an experience, not just a drink. Every cup of coffee served at Cup of Joy is a product of passion, 
                skill, and dedication. Our beans are handpicked from the finest farms, and each batch is carefully roasted to perfection.
            </p>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>Commitment to Quality</h2>
            <p>
                Quality is our cornerstone. We partner with local farmers and fair-trade organizations to ensure our coffee beans 
                are not only of the highest quality but also ethically sourced. Our team works tirelessly to ensure each blend 
                offers a unique flavor profile and a satisfying experience.
